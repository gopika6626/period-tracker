## Project Description
Luna is a smart period tracker website designed to help women log and predict their menstrual cycles. It provides features like an interactive calendar, AI-powered emotional support, an anonymous forum, and detailed cycle analytics.

## The Problem Statement
Managing menstrual health can be overwhelming without proper tracking. Many existing apps lack privacy, emotional support, and data-driven insights. Women need a comprehensive solution for both physical and emotional well-being.

## The Solution
Luna is more than just a tracker!
We combine AI with data analytics to predict cycles accurately, offer emotional support through an AI chatbot, and create a safe, anonymous community for women. It's your health companion, not just a calendar!

Frameworks Used: React.js (Frontend), Flask (Backend)
